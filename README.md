A finance manager written in Python.

It will ask for your salary for the month, which month you are working on, and how you will allocate parts of the salary to savings, rent and electricity.
It will then save that data, and check if there is any another data you would like to enter.

It can then show you any of the following calculations for the month of your choosing:

-How much you are spending on each allocation.\
-How much you are spending in total.\
-How much of your salary will remain after spendings.\
-Yearly estimates for rent and electricity.\
-Your salary if it were to the power of two.\
-Add an extra savings amount.
